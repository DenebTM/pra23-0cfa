# VU Program and Resource Analysis -- Programming Project 2: Control Flow Analysis

This project was created for the course "VU Program and Resource Analysis" as
part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Innsbruck,
during the winter semester 2023/2024.

It represents an implementation of a
[control flow analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_analysis) for
functional programs - specifically, 0-CFA - as presented in the book
[_Principles of Program Analysis_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-03811-6)
by Flemming Nielson, Hanne Riis Nielson and Chris Hankin.
